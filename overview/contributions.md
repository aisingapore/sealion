# Contributions

Launched in May 2017, AI Singapore is a national R&D programme in AI – the very first of its kind on a national level. Through SEA-LION, we aim to support **under-represented population groups and low-resource languages** in Southeast Asia. We welcome collaborations that further enhance our work and help our shared mission of democratizing AI.

We invite researchers, developers, language enthusiasts, and organizations to collaborate in **enhancing and expanding** the capabilities of our models. This page outlines the various ways you can work with us—whether it’s **joint model building, research partnerships, code contributions, documentation improvements**, or **data sharing**. 

We appreciate your interest in contributing to SEA-LION, and we look forward to collaborating with you!

## 1. Collaboration Opportunities



We offer various partnership modalities to suit different needs and interests, with a focus on open-sourcing results to benefit the wider community. For collaborations other than a self-serve model, an NDA/MOU/CA may have to be signed by both parties.

### Self-Service Model Usage

_Using our model (self-service)_

SEA-LION models are open-source so do feel free to download them for your own needs. If SEA-LION manages to be helpful to you/your team, we would love to hear about it and share your successes with our wider commnunity. Send us a note at sealion@aisingapore.org.

### Joint Model Building

_Building models together, Data contributions_

Have a unique dataset or domain expertise? Contribute data that we can incorporate into future SEA-LION releases. Collaborate with us to train specialized or improved versions of SEA-LION that will be open-sourced, benefiting both you and the broader community.

### Research Partnerships

If there are areas of research topics where you think that AISG and yourself can work together to work on a common research agenda that can further the work of SEA-LION, please feel free to reach out to us as well. We will be open to joint publications arising from these collaborations too.

If you are interested in any form of collaboration, please feel free to reach out to sealion@aisingapore.org

## 2. Community Contributions

In addition to formal partnerships, there are many individual and community-driven ways to help SEA-LION grow. Whether it’s fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, as a developer, researcher, or just an enthusiast, your input matters.
