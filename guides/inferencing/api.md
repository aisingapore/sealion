# SEA-LION API


The SEA-LION API provides a quick and simple interface to our various SEA-LION models for text generation, translation, summarization, and more. 

Usage of the SEA-LION API is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://sea-lion.ai/terms-of-use/) and [Privacy Policy](https://sea-lion.ai/privacy-policy/)

An API key will be generated for you after you click "Create". **Make sure to copy or download the generated key** and keep it in a safe place since you won't be able to view it again.

Only 1 API key is allowed to be created per user.

### How To Use Your API Key

#### Step 1. Find the Available Models

To find the available SEA-LION models for your API key, use the following curl command.

```
curl 'https://api.sea-lion.ai/v1/models' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your generated API key.

#### Step 2: Call the API

SEA-LION's API endpoints for chat and embeddings are compatible with OpenAI's API and libraries.
