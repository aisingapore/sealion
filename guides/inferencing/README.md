# Running SEA-LION Models for Inference

SEA-LION models are freely available for [download](/models/download_models.md), and can be run for inference in various ways. The following guides provide technical how-tos for setting up SEA-LION inference using different approaches:

1. [Using our provided SEA-LION API](./api.md)
2. Running SEA-LION on a local machine
3. Deploying SEA-LION on the cloud
