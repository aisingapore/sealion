# SEA-LION v4

SEA-LION version 4, released on Aug 25, is our first multimodal models trained on Southeast Asian text, each with their unique strengths:
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B.md) is suited for translation, abstractive summarisation, natural language inference and causal reasoning, metaphor understanding, question answering, paraphrase and sentiment analysis applications where regional language support and advanced reasoning is critical.
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B-IT](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B.md) is suited for knowledge-intensive tasks, and for high-demand contexts where comprehensive language comprehension are essential.
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B-IT-GGUF, NVFP4, FP8_Dynamic](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B-IT-quantized.md) supports inference on a range of consumer-grade GPUs and are compatible with various inference engines.

Trained off our SEA-LION v3.5 models, SEA-LION v4 continues our mission to create language models that understand and respond with greater cultural awareness and depth across Southeast Asia. In addition, SEA-LION v4 has the ability to handle both image and text input as a multimodal model.
