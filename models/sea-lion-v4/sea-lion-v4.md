# SEA-LION v4

SEA-LION version 4, first released in Aug 2025, is our first multimodal models trained on Southeast Asian text, each with their unique strengths:
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B.md) is suited for translation, abstractive summarisation, natural language inference and causal reasoning, metaphor understanding, question answering, paraphrase and sentiment analysis applications where regional language support and advanced reasoning is critical.
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B-IT](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B.md#training-procedure) is suited for knowledge-intensive tasks, and for high-demand contexts where comprehensive language comprehension are essential.
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B-IT-GGUF, NVFP4, FP8_Dynamic](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B.md#gemma-sea-lion-v4-27b-it-quantized-version) supports inference on a range of consumer-grade GPUs and are compatible with various inference engines.
- [Gemma-SEA-LION-v4-27B-VL](./gemma-sea-lion-v4-27B-VL.md)  is our powerful vision-language model, expertly trained to interpret both images and text with a deep, nuanced understanding of Southeast Asian cultural contexts.
- [Qwen-SEA-LION-v4-32B-IT](./qwen-sea-lion-v4-32B.md) is our flagship instruction-tuned model, designed for maximum performance in general SEA context tasks.
- [Qwen-SEA-LION-v4-32B-IT-4BIT, 8BIT](./qwen-sea-lion-v4-32B.md#available-versions)  offers a near-perfect balance of performance and efficiency, making the power of SEA-LION accessible on resource-constrained hardware like consumer-grade GPUs.
- [Qwen-SEA-LION-v4-4B-VL and 8B-VL](./qwen-sea-lion-v4-VL.md) are our latest specialized vision-language models featuring a native 256K context window and superior OCR capabilities for Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese. The 4B model is optimized for efficient edge deployment, while the 8B model is engineered for complex multi-modal reasoning.

SEA-LION v4 continues our mission to create language models that understand and respond with greater cultural awareness and depth across Southeast Asia. In addition, SEA-LION v4 has the ability to handle both image and text input as a multimodal model.
