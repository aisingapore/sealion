# Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B

## Introduction
Our Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B models have been continued pre-trained on top of the Gemma2 base model that is 9 billion parameters in size, and has a **context length of 8192**.

The training data for Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B comprises approximately **200B tokens** of Burmese, Chinese, English, Filipino, Indonesia, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese. The training data is sampled from the Dolma dataset, the original SEA-LION pretraining data, and Wiki sources for Burmese, Chinese, English, Filipino, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Indonesian, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese. In addition, the training data for SFT for the Instruct model includes Javanese and Sudanese.

Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B benefits from the strong Gemma2 performance in Southeast Asian (SEA) languages, allowing it to significantly outperform its predecessors across SEA evaluation metrics, indicating improved language capabilities for the SEA region.

Due to its pre-training and fine-tuning data mix, Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B exhibits a boost in natural language reasoning (NLR) abilities in Indonesian, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese, and achieves state-of-the-art performances in SEA instruction-following and multi-turn chat, while retaining Gemma2â€™s general abilities.

### Benchmark Performance
We evaluated Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B base model on general language capabilities.

#### General Language Capabilities
For the evaluation of general language capabilities, we employed the [SEA-HELM](/benchmarks/sea-helm.md) (also known as BHASA) evaluation benchmark across a variety of tasks.
These tasks include Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (Sentiment), Toxicity Detection (Toxicity), Translation in both directions (Eng>Lang & Lang>Eng), Abstractive Summarization (Summ), Causal Reasoning (Causal) and Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Note: SEA-HELM is implemented using prompts to elicit answers in a strict format. For all tasks, the model is expected to provide an answer tag from which the answer is automatically extracted. For tasks where options are provided, the answer should comprise one of the pre-defined options. The scores for each task is normalised to account for baseline performance due to random chance.

The evaluation was done **five-shot** with native prompts on a sample of 100-1000 instances for each dataset.

## Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT

Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT is a multilingual instruction-following model which has been fine-tuned with around **500,000 English instruction-completion pairs** alongside a larger pool of around **1,000,000 instruction-completion pairs** from other ASEAN languages, such as Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese.

### Fine-Tuning Methodology
Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT was built using a combination of a full parameter fine-tune, on-policy alignment, and model merges of the best performing checkpoints. The training process for fine-tuning was approximately 15 hours, with alignment taking 2 hours, both on 8x H100-80GB GPUs.

### Fine-Tuning Data
Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT was trained on a wide range of synthetic instructions, alongside publicly available instructions hand-curated by the team with the assistance of native speakers. In addition, special care was taken to ensure that the datasets used had commercially permissive licenses through verification with the original data source. 

#### Indonesian, Javanese & Sudanese Specific SEA-LION
Our partners at GoTo have continued pretrained and instruction tuned a variant of Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B, specifically enhancing its capabilities for Indonesian, Javanese, and Sundanese languages. Find the continued pretrained model at [Gemma2 9B CPT SahabatAIv1 Base](https://huggingface.co/GoToCompany/gemma2-9b-cpt-sahabatai-v1-base), and its corresponding instructioned tuned version at [Gemma2 9B CPT SahabatAIv1 Instruct](https://huggingface.co/GoToCompany/gemma2-9b-cpt-sahabatai-v1-instruct). 


### Benchmark Performance
We evaluated Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT on both general language capabilities and instruction-following capabilities.

#### General Language Capabilities
For the evaluation of general language capabilities, we employed the [SEA-HELM](/benchmarks/sea-helm.md) (also known as BHASA) evaluation benchmark across a variety of tasks.
These tasks include Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (Sentiment), Toxicity Detection (Toxicity), Translation in both directions (Eng>Lang & Lang>Eng), Abstractive Summarization (Summ), Causal Reasoning (Causal) and Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Note: SEA-HELM is implemented using prompts to elicit answers in a strict format. For all tasks, the model is expected to provide an answer tag from which the answer is automatically extracted. For tasks where options are provided, the answer should comprise one of the pre-defined options. The scores for each task is normalised to account for baseline performance due to random chance.

The evaluation was done **zero-shot** with native prompts on a sample of 100-1000 instances for each dataset.

#### Instruction-following Capabilities
Since Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT is an instruction-following model, we also evaluated it on instruction-following capabilities with two datasets, [IFEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911) and [MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685).

As these two datasets were originally in English, the linguists and native speakers in the team worked together to filter, localize and translate the datasets into the respective target languages to ensure that the examples remained reasonable, meaningful and natural.

**IFEval**

IFEval evaluates a model's ability to adhere to constraints provided in the prompt, for example beginning a response with a specific word/phrase or answering with a certain number of sections. Additionally, accuracy is normalized by the proportion of responses in the correct language (if the model performs the task correctly but responds in the wrong language, it is judged to have failed the task).


**MT-Bench**

MT-Bench evaluates a model's ability to engage in multi-turn (2 turns) conversations and respond in ways that align with human needs. We use `gpt-4-1106-preview` as the judge model and compare against `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` as the baseline model. The metric used is the weighted win rate against the baseline model (i.e. average win rate across each category: Math, Reasoning, STEM, Humanities, Roleplay, Writing, Extraction). A tie is given a score of 0.5.
