# Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B 
## Introduction
Our Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B models have been continued pre-trained on top of [Llama 3.1 8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) that is 8 billion parameters in size, with **context length of 128K tokens**, making it one of the SEA-LION models with the longest context length to date. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on regional benchmarks like SEA-HELM and outperforms models such as Llama 3.3 70B Instruct on key metrics.

Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B was trained on data comprised of approximately **200B tokens** across 11 SEA languages: Burmese, Chinese, English, Filipino, Indonesia, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese.

Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT was fine-tuned in two stages on approximately **12.3M English instruction-completion pairs** alongside a pool of **4.5M Southeast Asian instruction-completion pairs** from SEA languages such as Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese.

### Benchmark Performance
We evaluated Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B base model on general language capabilities and constraint-following behaviour.

#### General Language Capabilities and Constraint-following Behaviour
For the evaluation of general language capabilities, we employed the [SEA-HELM](/benchmarks/sea-helm.md) (also known as BHASA) evaluation benchmark across a variety of tasks.
These tasks include Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (Sentiment), Toxicity Detection (Toxicity), Translation in both directions (Eng>Lang & Lang>Eng), Abstractive Summarisation (Abssum), Causal Reasoning (Causal) and Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Note: SEA-HELM is implemented using prompts to elicit answers in a strict format. For all tasks, the model is expected to provide an answer tag from which the answer is automatically extracted. For tasks where options are provided, the answer should comprise one of the pre-defined options. The scores for each task is normalised to account for baseline performance due to random chance.

The evaluation was done **five-shot** with native prompts on a sample of 100-1000 instances for each dataset.

Following the implementation of IFEval in OpenLLM leaderboard, we also implement SEA-IFEval to provide a comparison of the ability of the model to follow specific constraints in English and in SEA languages.

**SEA-IFEval**

Based on [IFEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911), the linguists and native speakers in the team worked together to filter, localise and translate the datasets into the respective target languages to ensure that the examples remained reasonable, meaningful and natural.

SEA-IFEval evaluates a model's ability to adhere to constraints provided in the prompt, for example beginning a response with a specific word/phrase or answering with a certain number of sections. Additionally, accuracy is normalised by the proportion of responses in the correct language (if the model performs the task correctly but responds in the wrong language, it is judged to have failed the task).

## Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT
### Fine-Tuning Methodology
Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT is a multilingual instruction-following model that has been fine-tuned in two stages on approximately 12.3M English instruction-completion pairs alongside a pool of 4.5M Southeast Asian instruction-completion pairs from SEA languages such as Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese.

We performed instruction tuning in English and also in SEA languages such as Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese on our continued pre-trained Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B, to create Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT.

### Fine-Tuning Data
Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT was trained on a wide range of synthetic instructions, alongside publicly available instructions hand-curated by the team with the assistance of native speakers. In addition, special care was taken to ensure that the datasets used had commercially permissive licenses through verification with the original data source. 


### Benchmark Performance

We evaluated Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B Instruct on both general language capabilities and instruction-following capabilities.

#### General Language Capabilities
For the evaluation of general language capabilities, we employed the [SEA-HELM](/benchmarks/sea-helm.md) (also known as BHASA) evaluation benchmark across a variety of tasks.
These tasks include Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (Sentiment), Toxicity Detection (Toxicity), Translation in both directions (Eng>Lang & Lang>Eng), Abstractive Summarisation (Abssum), Causal Reasoning (Causal) and Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Note: SEA-HELM is implemented using prompts to elicit answers in a strict format. For all tasks, the model is expected to provide an answer tag from which the answer is automatically extracted. For tasks where options are provided, the answer should comprise one of the pre-defined options. The scores for each task is normalised to account for baseline performance due to random chance.

The evaluation was done **zero-shot** with native prompts on a sample of 100-1000 instances for each dataset.

#### Instruction-following Capabilities
Since Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT is an instruction-following model, we also evaluated it on instruction-following capabilities with two datasets, SEA-IFEval (based on [IFEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911)) and SEA-MTBench (based on [MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685)).

As these two datasets were originally in English, the linguists and native speakers in the team worked together to filter, localise and translate the datasets into the respective target languages to ensure that the examples remained reasonable, meaningful and natural.

**SEA-IFEval**

SEA-IFEval evaluates a model's ability to adhere to constraints provided in the prompt, for example beginning a response with a specific word/phrase or answering with a certain number of sections. Additionally, accuracy is normalised by the proportion of responses in the correct language (if the model performs the task correctly but responds in the wrong language, it is judged to have failed the task).


**SEA-MTBench**

SEA-MTBench evaluates a model's ability to engage in multi-turn (2 turns) conversations and respond in ways that align with human needs. We use `gpt-4-1106-preview` as the judge model and compare against `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` as the baseline model. The metric used is the weighted win rate against the baseline model (i.e. average win rate across each category: Math, Reasoning, STEM, Humanities, Roleplay, Writing, Extraction). A tie is given a score of 0.5.
