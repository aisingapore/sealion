# SEA-LION v2
## Introduction
SEA-LION version 2, released in July 2024, has been continued-pretrained on top of the [Llama 3 8B Instruct model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) that is 8 billion parameters in size, with **context length of 8192 tokens**.

Using continued-pretraining let us leverage the powerful capabilities of the Llama3 base model and build a stronger model with far fewer resources than pre-training from scratch. Compared to the 980B tokens used in for SEA-LION v1, approximately **48B** tokens across 5 SEA languages (English, Indonesia, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese) was used for the continued pre-training of SEA-LION v2.

### Benchmark Performance
We evaluated Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B base model on general language capabilities.

#### General Language Capabilities
For the evaluation of general language capabilities in SEA languages, we employed the [BHASA evaluation benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06085v2) across a variety of tasks.
These tasks include Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (Sentiment), Toxicity Detection (Toxicity), Translation in both directions (Eng>Lang & Lang>Eng), Abstractive Summarization (Summ), Causal Reasoning (Causal) and Natural Language Inference (NLI).

The evaluation was done **five-shot** with native prompts and only a sample of 100-1000 instances for each dataset was used as per the setting described in the paper.

## Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B-IT

Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B-IT is a multilingual instruction-following model which has been fine-tuned with around 100,000 English instruction-completion pairs alongside a smaller pool of around 50,000 instruction-completion pairs from other ASEAN languages, such as Indonesian, Thai and Vietnamese.

These instructions have been carefully curated and rewritten to ensure the model was trained on truly open, commercially permissive and high quality datasets.

### Fine-Tuning Methodology
The Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B-IT model was fine-tuned using 8x A100-40GB using parameter efficient fine tuning in the form of LoRA.

### Fine-Tuning Data
Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B-IT was trained on a wide range of instructions that were manually and stringently verified by our team. A large portion of the effort was dedicated to ensuring that each instruction-completion pair that the model sees is of high quality and any errors were corrected and rewritten by native speakers or else dropped from our mix.

In addition, special care was taken to ensure that the datasets used had commercially permissive licenses through verification with the original data source. 

### Benchmark Performance
We evaluated Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B-IT on both general language capabilities and instruction-following capabilities.

#### General Language Capabilities
For the evaluation of general language capabilities, we employed the [BHASA evaluation benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06085v2) across a variety of tasks. These tasks include Question Answering (QA), Sentiment Analysis (Sentiment), Toxicity Detection (Toxicity), Translation in both directions (Eng>Lang & Lang>Eng), Abstractive Summarization (Summ), Causal Reasoning (Causal) and Natural Language Inference (NLI).

Note: BHASA is implemented following a strict answer format, and only spaces and punctuations are cleaned. For tasks where options are provided, the answer should only include one of the pre-defined options, nothing else. If the model continues to generate more tokens (e.g. to explain its answer), it will be considered to be a wrong response. For the F1 score metric (as used in Sentiment Analysis and Toxicity Detection), all answers that do not fall under the pre-defined labels will be treated as a separate label (to mark it as a wrong answer) and included in the calculations so that the model is penalized for not generating one of the pre-defined labels.

The evaluation was done **zero-shot** with native prompts and only a sample of 100-1000 instances for each dataset was used as per the setting described in the paper.


#### Instruction-following Capabilities
Since Llama-SEA-LION-v2-8B-IT is an instruction-following model, we also evaluated it on instruction-following capabilities with two datasets, [IFEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911) and [MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685).

As these two datasets were originally in English, the linguists and native speakers in the team worked together to filter, localize and translate the datasets into the respective target languages to ensure that the examples remained reasonable, meaningful and natural.

**IFEval**

IFEval evaluates a model's ability to adhere to constraints provided in the prompt, for example beginning a response with a specific word/phrase or answering with a certain number of sections. The metric used is accuracy normalized by language (if the model performs the task correctly but responds in the wrong language, it is judged to have failed the task).


**MT-Bench**

MT-Bench evaluates a model's ability to engage in multi-turn (2 turns) conversations and respond in ways that align with human needs. We use `gpt-4-1106-preview` as the judge model and compare against `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` as the baseline model. The metric used is the weighted win rate against the baseline model (i.e. average win rate across each category (Math, Reasoning, STEM, Humanities, Roleplay, Writing, Extraction)). A tie is given a score of 0.5.
