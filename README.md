# SEA-LION (Southeast Asian Languages In One Network)

# <img align="center" src="images/purple_sealion-64x64.png"> A Family of Southeast Asian Language Models

***Updated: 31 July 2024***

SEA-LION is a family of open-source language models developed by AI Singapore that better understands Southeast Asia's diverse contexts, languages, and cultures (SEA). We hope it makes LLMs more accessible and better represents the region's breadth of cultures and languages.

Our first versions of SEA-LION, released in December 2023, were trained from scratched using [SEA-LION-PILE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aisingapore/sea-lion-pile) (about 1 trillion tokens). Our new version of SEA-LION is based on continued pre-training good open source models. Version 2 is based on Llama 3. We believe that this approach i.e. continued pre-training might be more sustainable over the longer-run. 

## Transparent and Open Source

We have benefited greatly from the open-source community and believe that efforts to better represent our region will similarly be well served by open-source efforts. SEA-LION will therefore be open and transparent in the following areas:

1. *Pre-Training* data
2. Model *training* code
3. Model *weights*
4. *Fine-Tuning* data
5. Evaluation *benchmarks*

# LATEST MODELS

## Key Features of SEA-LION v2

- Continued Pre-Trained and Fine-Tuned Llama 3 (with more models to follow)
- Instruction tuned in English, Bahasa Indonesia, Thai, Vietnamese, and Tamil 
- Trained with to 50B tokens from SEA languages
- Outperforms base Llama 3 and other models in both general and SEA capabilities
- Our contributions are open source (under MIT license); data and model licenses are listed on their respective Hugging Face data or model cards

See our [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/llama3-8b-cpt-sealionv2-instruct) for more detailed model and license information.

## How To Download SEA-LION v2

SEA-LION models are available for download on HuggingFace at:

### SEA-LION v2
**Base Models**
* [Llama3-8B-CPT-SEA-LION-V2-Base](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/llama3-8b-cpt-sealionv2-base)

**Instruction-Tuned Models**
* [Llama3-8B-CPT-SEA-LION-V2-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/llama3-8b-cpt-sealionv2-instruct)

**Quantized Models**

## Getting Started

To use SEA-LION v2:

```python
# Please use transformers==4.43.2

import transformers
import torch

model_id = "aisingapore/llama3-8b-cpt-sealionv2-instruct"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_id,
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
    device_map="auto",
)
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Apa sentimen dari kalimat berikut ini?\nKalimat: Buku ini sangat membosankan.\nJawaban: "},
]

outputs = pipeline(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=256,
)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1])

```

## Performance and Benchmarks

SEA-LION achieves better or competitive performances on tasks in regional languages, while retaining the general performance of Llama 3.

Our [leaderboard is here](https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai).

We use a holistic approach to evaluation, including not just traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarking tasks (such as sentiment analysis and question answering), but also linguistic and cultural diagnostic tests which are meticulously handcrafted. These are tailored to Southeast Asia.

The benchmark was introduced here [BHASA: A Holistic Southeast Asian Linguistic and Cultural Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06085v2) and [GitHub](https://github.com/aisingapore/bhasa).
