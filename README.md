# SEA-LION (Southeast Asian Languages In One Network) - A Family of Southeast Asian Language Models

SEA-LION is a family of open source language models developed by AI Singapore to better understand and represent the diverse contexts, languages, and cultures of Southeast Asia (SEA). 

## Key Features

- 3 to 7 billion parameters (larger models coming in 2024)
- Instruct-tuned in Bahasa Indonesia (more Southeast Asian languages in 2024)
- Trained on 980B tokens of text data from 11 languages spoken across SEA
- Specialized vocabulary and tokenization for optimal performance on SEA languages
- Excels on tasks in regional languages
- Open source under the MIT License for community contribution and adoption

## Getting Started

To use SEA-LION:

```python
# please use transformers 4.34.1
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("aisingapore/sealion3b", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("aisingapore/sealion3b", trust_remote_code=True)

tokens = tokenizer("Sea lion in the sea", return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(tokens["input_ids"], max_new_tokens=20)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### How To Download SEA-LION

SEA-LION models are available for download on HuggingFace at:

**Base Models**
* [SEA-LION 3B](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/sealion3b)
* [SEA-LION 7B](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/sealion7b)

**Instruct-Tuned**
* [SEA-LION 7B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/sealion7b-instruct-nc)


## Model Details

SEA-LION is based on the MPT architecture with 32 layers and comes in two sizes:

- [SEA-LION 3B](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/sealion3b) : 3 billion parameters 
- [SEA-LION 7B](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/sealion7b) : 7 billion parameters
- [SEA-LION 7B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/sealion7b-instruct-nc): 7 billion parameters, instruct-tuned in Bahasa Indonesia

It was trained on a diverse dataset of 980B tokens spanning 11 natural languages:

- English
- Chinese  
- Indonesian
- Malay
- Thai
- Vietnamese
- Filipino
- Tamil
- Burmese
- Khmer
- Lao

The model uses a vocabulary of 256,000 tokens and a context length of 2048 tokens. For tokenization, the model employs a custom SEA byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer which is specially tailored for SEA languages, ensuring optimal model performance.

## Performance

SEA-LION achieves better or competitive performances on tasks in regional languages:
