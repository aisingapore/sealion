**Southeast Asian Languages in One Network**

_Built for Southeast Asia, by Southeast Asia_

Southeast Asian Languages in One Network (SEA-LION) is a family of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) that better understands Southeast Asia’s (SEA) diverse contexts, languages, and cultures.

It is an open-source project anchored by the Products Pillar of AI Singapore. Our work in SEA-LION aims to create LLMs that cater to under-represented population groups and low resource languages in the SEA region. You can [read more about our motivations for SEA-LION here](/overview/why_sea-lion.md).

This site provides information and resources on SEA-LION, including how to access the models, hosting, and how-to guides.

## Performance and Benchmarks

SEA-LION has seen:

* In v1, ability to outperform most models based on SEA-HELM (Southeast Asian Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) when it was released
* In v2, outperformance for SEA tasks, while retaining credible performance on standard (English) benchmarks
* In v2.1, key improvements in conversational abilities across SEA languages, while providing more helpful and contextually appropriate responses to user prompts
* In v3, outperforms similar sized open source models, and even some larger models in both general and SEA capabilities
* In v3.5, ability to handle reasoning tasks, with the versatility of handling general tasks as well while maintaining similar performance with state-of-the-art models.
* In v4, our first multimodal SEA-LION model, this release extends SEA-LION beyond text to handle image + text inputs, while continuing our focus on Southeast Asian languages, culture, and use cases. 

We use a holistic approach to evaluation, including not just traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarking tasks (such as sentiment analysis and question answering) but also [meticulously handcrafted linguistic and cultural diagnostic tests tailored to Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06085v2).

Visit our [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai/) for more detailed breakdown on:

1. How SEA-LION compares to other available models along different metrics
2. What SEA-HELM is and the four key capabilities it is evaluated on: English performance, Proficiency in SEA chat, Instruction-following and Linguistic tasks
3. What each of these globally recognized metrics mean under SEA-HELM

## Licensing

**Transparent and Open Source**

We have benefited greatly from the open-source community and believe that efforts to better represent our region will similarly be well served by open-source efforts.

All SEA-LION releases will therefore embrace an open-source ethos under the MIT license as much as possible; however, the exact licensing terms may vary depending on the underlying base model’s restrictions or requirements. For instance, if the model leverages Meta’s Llama3 codebase, it may be bound by the [Llama3 License](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B/blob/main/LICENSE), which places certain restrictions on commercial use. Similarly, the Gemma-based variants may carry different terms. Users should always refer to the Hugging Face model card of each specific SEA-LION model for the most accurate, up-to-date license information.

SEA-LION will also be open and transparent in the following areas throughout this guide:

1. Pre-Training data
2. Model training code
3. Fine-Tuning data
4. Evaluation benchmarks
